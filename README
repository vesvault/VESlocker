server/: VESlocker Key Server
client/: VESlocker Client Library


- Encrypt data with a split key generated from local and remote components
- The remote key component is produced from a server-side secret and a
  client supplied challenge, which is seeded with a user provided PIN
- Each PIN attempt involves a remote key request with a different challenge
- The repeated requests of the remote key for each entry id are exponentially
  throttled, providing an effective lifetime limit on the number of attempts


REQUIREMENTS:
- Server:
    HTTP server with PHP support
    MySQL / MariaDB database
- Client:
    Javascript
